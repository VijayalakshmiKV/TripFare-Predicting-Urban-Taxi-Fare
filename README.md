This project is a data-driven regression system that predicts taxi fares for  metro cities using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Gradient Boosting.
The app provides a simple Streamlit web interface where users can input trip details and instantly get a predicted fare.
Project Overview

Built and evaluated multiple regression models to predict taxi fares.

The best-performing model (Random Forest Regressor) was saved and integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Includes feature engineering for real-world scenarios — weekends, night rides, surge rates, etc.

Designed and localized for Indian taxi systems
